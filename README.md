## 📝 Description

As an enthusiastic individual with a strong passion for finance and blockchain technology, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of these fields and their potential for transformative impact. My journey into the tech industry started with a deep interest in finance, where I gained a solid understanding of financial concepts, investment strategies, and market dynamics.

Driven by my curiosity and the desire to explore new opportunities, I recognized the significant role that technology plays in shaping the future of finance. This realization motivated me to delve deeper into the world of blockchain technology. I embarked on a path of self-learning, dedicating countless hours to studying programming in Plataforma5, a programming bootcamp. Now after graduating from my programming studies I am eager to seek a role in the tech industry were I can start using my skills as a professional software developer in the Tech field.
